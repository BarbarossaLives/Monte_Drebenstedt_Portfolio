        <p>When you're running or managing a small business, the right tools can mean the difference between frustration and flow. Off-the-shelf software often comes bloated with features you don’t need—or worse, lacks the specific functionality you do. That’s why having tools built specifically for your workflow, comfort level, and goals is invaluable.</p>

        <p>This project highlights a custom financial tool—a digital checkbook—built to do exactly what one business needed, no more, no less. It’s clean, simple, and focused. For some, that's all they need: a reliable, straightforward tool that doesn’t get in the way.</p>

        <p>But the real power comes in the potential for growth. Since I built the tool from the ground up, it can be expanded to track invoices, expenses, and even payroll, or integrated with other tools in your system. As your business evolves, your tools can evolve with you.</p>

        <p>My goal is to create software that fits your habits, your needs, and your knowledge level—nothing confusing or overwhelming. Just tools that work for you, not the other way around.</p>

        <p>If you’re looking for business tools that feel natural and work the way you do, let’s build them—together.</p>
